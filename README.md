## Features

#### Accordion Category Tree Extension

Allows you to nest subcategories under the parent for a slimmer display.

#### Custom Selects Extension

Automatically converts the standard select element into a more stylish version 
without sacrificing functionality.

#### Omega Navigation Extension

Omega takes the Transfigure Navigation Extension one step further. Not only is 
it mobile friendly, but it allow for quick display of nested subcategories in a 
thoughtful layout.

#### Product Imagery Extension

This long awaited extension bring the concept of a product image gallery to 
ReadyThemes. With it, you can display the image thumbnails in a vertical 
carousel next to the main image. Then, when you click to zoom, you can view all 
the product images as a carousel in a light-box.

#### Radio to Button Extension

Automatically converts the radio style product attribute into a more usable 
button.

#### Refinery Extension

This is a more stylized form of product faceting used on the category, product 
list, and search pages. It shows which have been selected, allowing for easy 
clearing of a single facet or all. Additionally, if you have a large number of 
facets, it displays the first few and allows for all to be viewed in an 
off-canvas menu.

#### Show Related Extension

Allows for adding show/hide functionality to related items which are not 
immediate children of the trigger element.

#### Subscription Combo Extension

This fun extension allows for the "Single Purchase" and "Subscription Terms" 
options on the product page to be contained in a more semantic and design 
friendly way.
